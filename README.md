# BlazorTabulator

This project is a C# Razor class library (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/class-libraries?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio) for Tabulator (http://tabulator.info).

The included WebAssemblySample project provides a Blazor Webassembly application that consumes the BlazorTabulator Razor class library.

The goal for this project is to provide a rich experience to allow developers to generate beautiful, functional tables using C# with idiomatic Razor syntax.
